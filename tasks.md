- **3.2. Components Creation:**
  - [ ] Create a layout component (header, footer).
  - [ ] Develop a login/register component.
  - [ ] Design course addition and display component.
  - [ ] Craft assignment and test tracking components.
  - [ ] Formulate components to add, view, edit, and delete resources.
  
- **3.3. State Management:**
  - [ ] Use React's Context API or Redux for state management.
  - [ ] Set up state and reducers/actions for Users, Courses, Resources, Assignments, and Tests.
  
- **3.4. Connect Frontend with Backend:**
  - [ ] Use Axios to send and receive HTTP requests to/from the backend.
  - [ ] Connect registration and login components to backend authentication routes.

#### **6. Deployment:**
- [ ] Prepare the app for production (e.g., set NODE_ENV to 'production').
- [ ] Deploy the backend on a platform like Heroku.
- [ ] Build the React app for production and deploy on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or directly on Heroku.
